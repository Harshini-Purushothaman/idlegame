Introduction
idlegame is a terminal-based idle game designed for software developers to pass time while learning some Zsh commands in a fun and interactive way. It's lightweight, casual, and perfect for short breaks or those moments when you’re waiting for a build or a deployment.

Prerequisites
Before you can enjoy idlegame, make sure you have the following:

Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
A terminal that supports Zsh commands
Installation
Getting started with idlegame is a breeze. Open your terminal and run the following command to install the game:

bash
Copy code
pip install idlegame
Usage
Once it’s installed, you can start playing by simply typing the command below in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
idlegame
Features
Easy to Play: Install and start playing with just two commands.
Casual Gameplay: Perfect for quick breaks or whenever you need a distraction.
Offline Play: Your nanobots continue working even when you’re not actively playing.
IncrediSave: Automatic saving ensures you never lose your progress.
How to Play
idlegame is a game designed with two purposes in mind:

To entertain you during work breaks.
To teach you some useful Zsh commands.
Each command in idlegame is a valid Zsh or CLI command. You’ll be able to script and manage nanobots that help you mine resources and defend your filetree.

For instance, create a nanobot using the command below:

bash
Copy code
nano --name mine&defend -y
You can script these nanobots to perform actions such as mining resources and defending against invaders. They will work even when you’re not playing.

Quickstart Example
Below is an example of how to quickly set up a nanobot:

bash
Copy code
Logged in as: bb
bb@idlegame % uptime
The command will display the uptime of your nanobots. To create a nanobot, use:

bash
Copy code
nano --name mine&defend -y
You can then define the bot’s logic:

bash
Copy code
idle mine
on invasion defend
done
Your nanobot will now automatically mine resources and defend your filetree when invaded.

Help & Troubleshooting
If you ever get stuck, use the following command for help:

bash
Copy code
man
You’ll get a list of available commands or details about specific commands by typing man [command name].
